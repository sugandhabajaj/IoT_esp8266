The project establishes TCP/IP connection between the server and client to switch the LED ON/OFF.

# ABOUT Project

With the rising power of technology, we are able to accomplish things at a much quicker rate.  We have at the touch of a button access to large amounts of information due to the capability of computers and the Internet.This project presents a low cost and flexible home control and monitoring system using an embedded micro-web server, with IP connectivity for accessing and controlling devices and appliances remotely using Android based Smart phone app.
We are targeting Android platform since it has huge market and open source. Wi-Fi module ESP8266 is used to receive commands from the internet and activate home appliances which is directly connected from an android application. The application not only controls the appliances but also analyses the usage and gives certain outputs.
The proposed system consists of two main components:
 •	The server (web server), which presents system core that manages, controls, and monitors users’ home. Users and system administrator can locally (LAN) or remotely (internet) manage and control system code.
 •	Hardware interface module, which provides appropriate interface for the sensors and actuator of home automation system.

# Some interesting features of the IoT:

•	Numerous objects: The IoT evolves into a large number of objects that collectively move toward a state of pervasiveness.
•	Autonomous functioning: With minimal human intervention, objects in the IoT will perform data collection, processing, collaborating with each other, and decision-making in an autonomous fashion.
•	Heterogeneous communication and computation capabilities: Objects in the IoT might support different wireless communication technologies (such as Bluetooth low energy [BLE], Global System for Mobile Communications [GSM], near field communication [NFC], Wi-Fi, and Zigbee) and computing power. As a result, objects might play different roles in different IoT scenarios.
•	Interdependency between the cyber and the physical world: For example, in one well-known IoT, the smart grid, the physical world cooperates with the cyber network.
•	Complex network structure: With various radio interfaces, objects can communicate with each other in more complicated ways, forming a complex. For example, an object may communicate with another object via a GSM interface over cellular networks, while also communicating with a different object in the geographic vicinity via proximity-based communication technologies using BLE or Wi-Fi Direct.
